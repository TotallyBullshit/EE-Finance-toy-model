there are two models contained in this file

model one consists of model1.R and model_initialize.R

model two also has a model file and an initialize file, both of which have 'bank_hurdle' in the name. it also uses the newton_solve.r file

both models draw on the excel_finance_functions.r file, which provides some basic excel-like functions
